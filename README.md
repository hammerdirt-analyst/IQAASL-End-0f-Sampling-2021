# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale litter surveys are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that are within the catchment area.

## Purpose

This reposistory maintains all beach-litter-survey data collected in Switzerland since November 2015, with the exception of data generated by *Surfrider Europe* 
and *Sol a Tous* who refused to share the data they collected. 

This repo provides the tools (Jupyter notebooks) for analyzing the data at different aggregation levels and includes land-use calculations for all survey locations, see the "land_use_correlation" note book.
