# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/382063409.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/382063409)

IQAASL was a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale litter surveys are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, RhÃ´ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that are within the catchment area.

This report was included in the Federal Office of the Environment Theme : [Waste along swiss lakes and rivers](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/waste/dossiers/waste-along-swiss-rivers-and-lakes.html)

Since this report was produced there have been a few projects of interest:

Their are two python modules: 1. reportingmethods.py and 2. prompts.py. Reporting methods is a collection of 
functions and three classes that are used to generate the contents of most chpaters. The prompts module contains
the labels and prompts that used in the AI assisted reporter
