# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL was a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale litter surveys are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, RhÃ´ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that are within the catchment area.

This project used the existing technology infrastrucutre to enter, store and report the survey findings. This repo is the cumualtive sum of that work.

## Contributing

This report was the inspiration for three manuscripts in devlopment and could serve as an initiation to data science and computing. Specifically for those interested in discrete, `random` observations or count data methods this repo may provide you with a new challenge.

Currently there is a team working on the application of a simple machine learning model that describes the probability of finding an object given the data. Development has also begun on a more complex model that predicts the range of probable values that a person may encounter.

The methods and formatting used in this report are being refactored for use in the [ litter surveyor ](https://www.plagespropres.ch/) as the evolution of that application continues.

There are ample oportunities to learn, teach and contribute.
