# Executive summary
Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to collect data concerning visible pollutants along Swiss lakes and rivers. All of the discarded materials were collected and identified using beach litter survey techniques. The sampling period was 2020-03 through 2021-05 a total of 54,744 objects were removed and classified in the course of 386 surveys along Swiss water systems. The survey areas were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers. Surveys were conducted at 143 different locations, representing 77 municipalities and a combined population of approximately 1,735,991.

## Assessement method
In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) [eall09]. This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (The guide) [Han13]. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in _The guide_. 

*A beach-litter survey is the accounting of visible anthropogenic material identified within a delimited area that is bordered on one side by a lake, river or ocean.*

* Locations are defined by their GPS points 
* Length and width are measured for each survey area 
* Visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, counted and weighed
* All items are classified based on code definitions included in _The guide_.

To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For example, codes were developed for items such as pheromone bait containers and ski poles to account for the occurrence of these objects when identified in certain regions. Identifying and quantifying items allows researchers and stakeholders to determine probable sources and define reduction strategies targeting specific items. For the complete list of item identification codes and definitions [Code groups](codegroups).

## Lakes and rivers
The majority of the surveys were lake side (331 samples). Lakes offer a more consistent and safe survey environment with respect to rivers. In addition, lakes are large areas of reduced flow that receive input from multiple rivers, streams and drainage systems and provide ideal locations to assess the type and composition of the variety of transported or directly deposited objects.

In total 316 samples came from seven principal lakes in 3 major river basins. Twenty locations were selected to sample monthly for a twelve-month period with the exception of Lake Maggiore which was sampled every three months to capture seasonal data. There were 222 surveys at these locations with a total of 37,406 objects removed and identified. Surveys were also conducted on Lago di Lugano, Lac des Quatre cantons, Brienzersee and Zugersee. In addition there were 55 surveys on 16 rivers. The median survey total was 75p/100m for 2,475 objects removed from river shorelines. Preference was given to river locations with preexisting data.

The frequency of surveys identified significant seasonal patterns, which may be considered when using raw data for long-term trend analyses detailed in: *Survey results.* A major site selection criterion was available previous data collected following similar protocols. Of the twenty sites sampled monthly, eleven had preexisting data. More information on survey site criteria is available at: Selection of Survey Sites Litter surveyor (plagespropres.ch)

## Assessment metric
The median value (50th percentile) of the survey results is reported as number of objects per 100m (p/100m) of shore line. This is the method described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines and is the standard used in this report. The 100-meter shoreline standard used in the marine environment is appropriate for coastal regions of the European continent however urbanization and topography of Swiss freshwater systems, present unique challenges when selecting locations suitable to safely conduct yearlong shoreline litter surveys. Limiting surveys to 100 meters of exposed shoreline would have dramatically reduced the number of available survey locations as well as the use of preexisting data. Thus, the IQAASL reflects local topography with a median survey length of 45m, and an average of 51m. Surveys less than 10m were not considered in the baseline analysis. 

### Median survey total
The median survey value was selected due to the variability of litter surveys and the effects of extreme values on aggregated results[HG19]. Commonly a particular item will have a median value of zero at one aggregation level and not the other. This particularity is extremely useful to determine the location and frequency of identified items.

The median survey total of the 386 surveys was 189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare suvey area). The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed plastics at the Rhône river out flow in the upper lake region. 
A reference value was calculated excluding the results from samples that were less than 10m and objects less than 2.5cm. This method, described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines [HG19] was used to calculate the reference and threshold values for all European beaches in 2015 and 2016 resulting in a median value of 131 p/100m compared to 181p/100m in Switzerland using the data from IQAASL. The results from the European baseline value lie outside the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147 - 213p/100m established using the data from IQAASL.

Surveys in Switzerland are on average shorter than surveys in the marine environment and in locations that would be considered urban under most circumstances. To date monitoring of lakes and rivers upstream of coastal regions has not generalized on the European continent. However, there is a concerted effort by a group of associations in Suisse romande and France to establish a common monitoring and data exchange protocol for the Rhône basin. The Wageningen University & Research has begun analyzing data collected in the Meusse - Rhine delta using protocols similar to those in IQAASL [vE08].

### The most common objects
The most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent ≈68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. Of the most common items identified ≈ 27% are food and tobacco related and ≈24% are infrastructure and agriculture related. 

Objects related to food and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage of land attributed to buildings or fixed infrastructure, the inverse is true of the locations with a higher percentage of land attributed to woods or agriculture. However, objects related to infrastructure, specifically foamed plastics for insulation, are found at ≈ rates throughout all survey areas indifferent of land use surrounding survey locations.

Two of the most common objects were identified in less than 50% of the surveys. Both are less than 5mm in diameter and are considered micro-plastics. Industrial pellets were identified in all survey areas. The highest rates were recorded at Préverenges, Genève, Lugano and Biel. Expanded foams < 5mm are the result of the fragmentation of expanded polystyrene and at times were identified in large quantities.

To analyze regional differences and similarities survey locations are divided into 4 survey areas:
* Aare survey area: Lakes; Bielersee, Brienzersee, Neuenburgersee, Thunersee
  Rivers/streams; Aare, Aare|Nidau-Büren-Kanal, Emme, La Thièle, Schüss

* Linth/Limmat survey area: Lakes; Quatre Cantons, Walensee, Zugersee, Zurichsee
  Rivers/streams; Dorfbach, Escherkanal, Jona, Limmat, Linthkanal, Reuss, Seez, Sihl

* Rhône survey area: Lac Léman and Rhône river

* Ticino/Cerisio survey area: Lakes; Lago Maggiore, Lago di Lugano 
  Rivers/streams; Cassarate, Maggia, Ticino

*The most common objects identified by survey area: median p/100m*

The most common objects are found at different rates depending on the survey area and in some cases the land-use conditions. As a result, regional priorities may be different.

### Comparing 2017-2018¶ and 2020-2021 results
Considering only the lakes and rivers that have data in both 2018 and 2020 sampling periods more samples and more litter were collected from fewer locations in 2018 than 2020. However, on a pieces per meter basis the mean, median and maximum were all higher in 2020. The summary statistics and the results of the difference of means test implies there was no measurable change on the national scale from one sampling period to the other.
The 95% CI of the median survey total in 2020 was 137 - 188p/100m. The median result for 2018 was 125p/100m with a 95% CI of 112p/100m to 146p/100m, which includes the lower bound of the median from 2020. However, the difference of means for the most common objects suggest a more realistic and dynamic result:

There was a slight decrease in litter items associated with behavior:

* cigarette ends
* metal bottle caps
* glass bottles

There was a slight increase in other items:

* industrial sheeting
* plastic construction waste
* other plastic and foam products
* cotton swabs

The decrease in tobacco and food related products is likely the result of pandemic related restrictions that marked 2020. Increases of industrial sheeting, plastic construction waste and other plastic foam products or cotton swabs cannot be attributed to a specific event.
These results suggest that perceived local decreases in litter quantities were likely the result of a general decline in usage as opposed to a sweeping change in behavior. Consequently, the survey results for items associated with behavior will likely return to 2018 levels or greater as pandemic related restrictions are relaxed and usage patterns return to normal.

## The Alps and the Jura
The IQAASL project included an onboarding process to allow other associations and groups to participate in data collection using a basic reporting system that can be maintained by staff of either organization. This report includes an Alpes survey area, configured and managed by the Summit Foundation. The Summit Foundation conducted clean up events throughout the Swiss Alpes over the summer of 2021. At each event the length and width of the survey area was measured, all visible objects within the survey area were collected, counted, classified and weighed. Regional objects of interest were identified with supplementary codes. The integration of litter-surveys with clean-up events is possible provided there are sufficient resources allocated to ensure that the samples are collected according to the protocol and processed appropriately.

Of the twenty surveys in the Alpes survey area 17 met the length and width criteria of greater than 10m. The median survey value was 110 p/100m, less than the median value of all the other survey areas (189 p/100m). Objects related to consumption such as food and drink or tobacco were a smaller percent of the total and had a lower p/100m rate compared to the results from shoreline locations. This difference could be in part due to the low levels of urbanization that characterizes the Alpes survey area with respect to all other survey areas and the tendency of material to flow downstream. The results from the Alps and Jura are considered separately from the analysis of the results from lakes and rivers and discussed further in: *The Alps and the Jura* section.

## Communicating results
The median survey result can create challenges for organizations that are attempting to raise awareness. The desire is to convert the survey results into a simple metric such as average pieces per 100m. For communicating pollution quantities, it is more interesting as the average is never zero. However, the average maybe twice the median when extreme values are not accounted for when considering survey total results. 
Both methods are correct mathematically. The average value will mostly likely be larger but the median value is a better approximation of what a sample would look like if the experiment was repeated. This concept is central to most monitoring systems based on count data and is a measure of repeatability.
For communications purposes the total quantity by region or the percent of total may be the easiest method. Using the more detailed and precise p/100m rating for specific examples. Consider this interpretation of the amounts of industrial pellets found on Lac Léman.
There were 1’387 GPI or 5% of all objects identified on Lac Léman. The number of pellets per 100m ranges from 1-1006 depending on the region. For the lake in general there is a 40% chance of finding at least one pellet at a survey. In some locations like Genève, Préverenges, St. Sulpice and Vidy the chances of finding at least one pellet is 90% and the number found is between 3p/100m and 105p/100m.
Communicating the range of likely values and the locations where they may be found is much more precise and informative. Furthermore, the cited ranges reflect the true survey results implying that these values could be verified within a certain confidence interval (which they can).
A proposed solution is to include the average p/100m with the summary values. This would allow stakeholders a value that is perhaps easier to communicate but can always be referenced within the context of this report. An example is the table of most common objects from Lac Léman:

## Conclusions
Count methods remain the preferred method for assessing litter composition and density along the shoreline. Although there is no standard method on the continent for assessing the litter in fresh water systems all indications are that this will soon change. 

Three of the four survey areas already have active monitoring by research and governmental agencies downstream of Switzerland. The methods used are similar to those presented in this report. Regional associations in Switzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner organizations in the EU. 

On a national scale the survey results remain stable with respect to 2018. However, there was a general decrease in the quantity of food and tobacco objects and an increase in the amount of infrastructure related items. The pandemic related restrictions may have had a beneficial effect on survey results of food and tobacco items. The increases in infrastructure related objects were felt most acutely in Valais and Vaud from the Rhône outfall and in Brienze from the Aare outfall to Brienzersee.

The land use around a survey location has a measurable effect on the deposition of certain objects. The more buildings and fixed infrastructure there are the more tobacco and food products are found. Objects like fragmented plastics and industrial sheeting do not have the same association and are found at approximately equal rates indifferent of the land use.

There is an emphasis in the Lac Léman region on the reduction of littering. This is perhaps the reason why the Rhône survey area is the only survey area where infrastructure related objects out number food and drink. Which makes the case for targeted communication strategies for the other most abundant objects either regionally or nationally.

There is broad-based support for this type of reporting method. This remains a citizen-science project that only uses open source tools and shares data on GNU public license. Which means that contributing and editing can be done collaboratively by the stake-holders. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, hammerdirt will assume the responsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.

The associations that participated are actively seeking ways to incorporate the process or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional associations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most. One reason is because the file sizes are large and data is constantly being added and new independent variables are being formatted, making email exchanges extremely inefficient. 

## Recommendations
Efficiencies in data exchange and reporting would be realized immediately by increasing the number of data scientists in regional and local environmental associations. Assessment of pollution, effects of reduction programs, and to estimate any changes it is necessary to generate a minimum number of surveys per sampling period and expand baseline information. Sharing common data science practices will expand the uses of existing and future data, facilitate monitoring strategies and define reduction targets.

    Develop a network of associations that use open-source data repositories to monitor, maintain and improve reporting methods.

    Create a standard report format to facilitate communications between municipal, cantonal and regional/district administrations and improve coordination of regional and local reduction strategies.

    Develop communication strategies for the most common objects

Formally include academia in the planning, sampling and analysis. This project was influenced with collaborative university professors from ETH, UNIGE, EPFL, PSI and FHNW. University partners would be ideal to continue developing analytical methods. The Citizen Science Center (ETH) and Citizen Cyberlab (UNIGE) have the experienced and infrastructure to connect citizen science monitoring projects to research efforts. Thus, creating a very adaptive and efficient monitoring plan.

## Elimination and reduction strategies
The simplest terms to describe litter pollution by sources are direct or indirect in relation to the surveyed site. A broad classification influenced by data, research, years of field experience, observations and professional judgement of litter evaluations in our region.
 
Direct describes individual comportment on our near Swiss shorelines. Impactful litter reduction and elimination strategies should target items regularly discarded by beach goers such as food, drink, tobacco and personal use items.
 
Reduction strategies may include:
* Adequate weather and animal resistant trash receptacles
* Sensibilization and deterrent tactics
* Limited night-time shoreline access
* Increased portable toilets during seasonal demand
* Reduced single use plastic reliance

Indirect refers to material that is likely transported to sites by aeolian and especially fluvial systems; rivers, streams, canals, and drainage networks. Items such as plastic ear swab sticks, media filters, pre-production plastic pellets, industrial sheeting, foamed plastics for insulation likely represent a systematic loss of material escaping current pollution management practices.
 
Reduction strategies may include:
* Upgrading waste water treatment facilities to reduce material loss from commonly toilet flushed plastic hygiene items.
* Targeted sensibilization and enforcement of current environmental protection regulations aimed at plastic injection molding facilities to eliminate loss of pellets, plastic shavings and fragments from CNC operations.
* Targeted sensibilization and enforcement of current environmental protection regulations at infrastructure and agricultural sites to eliminate loss of industrial sheeting, foamed insulation plastics and construction plastics.

Elimination and reduction strategies should target the most common objects, defined as objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent ≈ 68% of all objects found in the sampling period. Of the most common objects, those related to food or tobacco were ≈ 27% of all objects found, compared to ≈ 24% of objects related to infrastructure and agriculture.

Reducing reliance on single use plastics, foamed plastics, construction plastics and industrial sheeting and films would likely greatly reduce the quantities escaping into the natural environment. The low cost and disposable nature of these materials have resulted in an ever-increasing abundance and reliance in all sectors. The light-weight and degradable attributes of these materials facilitate fragmentation and absconding into the natural systems especially with prolonged exposure outdoors. These pollutants are a global problem and increasingly nations are banning specific single use plastic items and polystyrenes.
