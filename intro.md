# Identification, quantification and analysis of swiss litter (IQAASL)

__Edition 1__ ver=0.72 _unlock key indicators and landuse_

__Note__: all results before ver=1 are considered interim and should not be referenced.

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

This report is a summary and analysis of the beach-litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020
to July 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) {cite}`slr`, the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the _Guide to monitoring beach litter_ {cite}`mlwguidance` or any other comparable method. 

The median survey results are presented down to the municipal level for each location that was sampled. The results are in units of _objects found per 100 meters_ (pieces/100m).

:::
_There were 400 samples from 157 locations in 90 different municipalities, all survey areas considered._

Out of 400 surveys 331 were on 11 lakes.The median survey result was 181 pieces per 100 meters (p/100m), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147p/100m - 213p/100m. This represents 54,337 objects or $\approx$ 306kg including 95kg of plastic. The total linear distance surveyed was $\approx$ 20 km with a surface area of 9 hectares.  Both Geneva and Zurich are included putting the total municipal population with a stake in this report at 1.7 million.

The most common objects are defined as those objects that were found in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent $\approx$ 68% of all objects found in the sampling period.

## Using this report

If a municipality or water feature was sampled the results are included in this report. As of ver=1 the conclusions, with respect to this 
report are considered final.

It is important to understand the difference between the _median_ {cite}`mediandef` and the _average_ {cite}`meandeff` when interpreting the results. Except for
monthly results the survey results are given as the __median__ p/100m for the location in question. Consider the __median__ survey result for 
the most common objects on Thunersee and Brienzersee:
<br></br>

:alt: Heat map of most common objects Thunersee and Brienzersee
:class: bg-primary mb-1

:align: center
:::
<br></br>
The results from all survey areas are on the far right column, preceded by the aggregated results from Thunersee and Brienzersee. The first six columns are
the municipalities where the samples were taken. This standard is maintained throughout the document.

The number represents the median survey value for that object. If that object is not found in at least half of the surveys then the median value will be zero. In other
words the median value is an indicator of minimum number that you are likely to find on the shore line.

The results for plastic construction waste indicate that it was more prevalent in Bönigen \(4.5p/100m\) and Unterseen \(1.5p/100m\) versus the other
municipalities where the median value is zero. However Industrial sheeting and cigarettes were located at all municipalities in at least 1/2
surveys.

In practical terms if a person in the region of Interlaken wanted to find plastic construction waste there was a better chance of finding it 
on the beach Bönigen and Unterseen than the other municipalities. However if that person was looking for Industrial sheeting they had an $\approx$ chance of finding it anywhere but they would find the
most at Brienze (67p/100m).

The [key indicators](keyindicators) chapter gives a precise definition of each of the basic statistics that can be derived from the survey results
and how they are used for identifying zones of accumulation and significant events. The methods used to calculate the different 
environmental variables are explained in [_The land use profile_](luseprofile). The codes and descriptions used to identify the
items as well as the different economic groupings are covered in detail in [_Code groups_](codegroups). How samples are collected and the
methods for identifying extreme values and calculating baselines for a region can be found here [_Beach litter baselines_](threshhold).

The results for each municipality are included with the lake or river to which they belong. A more detailed report can be produced for any
municipality in this document. Requests for more information should be sent to the Municipal waste section of Swiss federal office for the 
environment.

### Contributing to this report

This report is versioned therefore it is very easy to submit articles or analysis that correct, clarify or improve the content of this report. The easiest
way to contribute is to send a pull request to [end of sampling repo](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021).

If this not possible please contact analyst-at-hammerdirt-dot-ch (currently responsible for maintaining version control). 

### Collecting data

A beach litter survey can be conducted by anybody at anytime. If the survey is conducted according to the method described in _The Guide_ {cite}`mlwguidance` or here [Beach litter baselines](threshhold) the result can be compared directly to the charts in this report. There is no need to enter the data into the system to compare results.

**Contributing data** for the report (or the next report) requires some on the job training and an evaluation. It usually takes 3-5 surveys to acclimate an individual to the task. Most of the time is spent identifying objects and the importance of maintaining a field notebook. The advantage to contributing data is that the reporting procedure is automated and there is always access to the results.

Contact shannon-at-hammerdirt-dot-ch or the Municipal waste section of the Swiss federal office for the environment for more information.

## Trends from 2017

**When the lake and rivers with samples in both projects are considered** there was no statistical difference between the SLR results and IQAASL. The survey results
show that in 2020 there were fewer cigarettes, bottle tops and glass fragments and more cotton swabs, industrial sheeting and plastic construction waste.

## Shared responsibility

According to the Law for the protection of the environment the pincipal of causality is defined as:

> The person who initiates a measure prescribed by this Act shall bear the costs thereof.

We use beach litter survey results to move up the causal chain to identify secondary sources of litter.
