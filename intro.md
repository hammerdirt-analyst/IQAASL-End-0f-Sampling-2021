# The Litter Surveyor Report

The _Litter Surveyor_ is a summary and analyis of the litter surveys conducted in Switzerland since 2017 and how those results relate to the experiences of our European neighbors.

In September 2020 the EU adopted a common benchmarking and assessment method using the results from beach litter surveys that were conducted  following a very similary protocol to the one used in Switzerland since 2017. The __definition of a common assessement method to compare results from beach litter surveys from one sampling period to the next__ is an important development that __equips administrators and stakeholders with an objective, standardized method to assess performance of litter mitigation strategies over time at a local level__. 

The _Litter Surveyor Report_ integrates the methods proposed by the EU as a set of tools to interpret current beach litter survey results from the national to the municipal level.

This is version 0.03 _The review draft: analysis and cartography_

__Content revisions__ I have received a few comments and will address them during this version. The numerical results will not change, unless somebody finds a mistake!

We are adding the following during this review:

* lake and city results
* images

## Summary of all surveys

The sampling period (SP) was from April 01, 2020 - May 31, 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) {cite}`slr` the
last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the _Guide to monitoring beach litter_ or any other comparable method.

_There were 385 samples from 143 locations in 77 different municipalities._

The median survey result was 158 pieces per 100 meters (p/100m), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 137p/100m - 188/p100m. This represents 54,713 recorded objects or
$\approx$ 306kg of trash including $\approx$ 96kg of plastic. The total linear distance surveyed was $\approx$ 20 km or a surface area of 9 hectares. The study was focussed on lakes, 331/385 samples come from 11 lakes. Both Geneva
and Zurich are included putting the total municipal population with a stake in this report at 1.7 million.

See the section [_All Survey areas_](allsurveys) for complete details.

### Trends from 2017

**When the lake and rivers with samples in both projects are considered** there was no statistical difference between the SLR results and IQAASL. The survey results
show that in 2020 there were fewer cigarettes, bottle tops and glass fragments and more cotton swabs, industrial sheeting and plastic construction waste.

### Local versus regional

Beach litter surveys are collections of many individual surveys. Here we compare the results of two different groups of items under two opposite land use conditions (see [_The land use profile_](luseprofile)). In one group the use case is well known and the connection to human behavior and the land use is uncontested: tobacco and snacks, this group is called _contributed_. The other group includes fragmented objects of different densities, specific objects less than 5mm and construction plastics, none of which show any association to measurable land use features, this group is called distributed


See the section [_Transport an empirical approach_](transport)

### Baseline and extreme values

The proposed methods in the JRC Technical document _An Analysis of a pan-European 2012-2016 beach litter dataset_ are applied to the results from IQAASL. The baseline values are calculated for each survey area and examples are given of the the different methods to identify extreme values.

### Sources

Economically the sources are determined by grouping the codes assigned to the objects according to use or description. Combined food and tobacco items make up 36% of the items found and infrastructure and agriculture are 24% of the total. Objects originating from waste water facilities or objects less than five millimeters make up another 10%. The relative amounts change for each survey area suggesting that local priorities may not always match regional priorities.

See the section [_Code groups_](codegroups) for a complete definition of how the codes were grouped.

### The structure and evolution of this document

The purpose is to provide a repeatable method and process to collect and evaluate beach-litter data at a scale that is appropriate to Switzerland and exploitable by
all stakeholders. The method and process need to reflect current advances in the field, the needs of stakeholders and faithfully report the survey results as collected
by the surveyor.

This document is a collection of scripts written in python and markdown contained in a series of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis. This
system has been in use for quite some time in the research community. Together those scripts make a book, or a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

The surveyor uses this application [plagespropres](https://www.plagespropres.ch/) to submit data and the report is processed here: [end of sampling repo](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021).

Not all tasks have been automated. Land use data is calculated using QGIS and the method to automate this process has not been developed.

# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.
