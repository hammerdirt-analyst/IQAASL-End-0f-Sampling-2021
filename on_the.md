### On the difference of survey results between the survey areas

Sample locations in the RSA tend to have more buildings and streets and less woods or agriculture than the locations in the other survey areas. As recent as 2017 a global study identified differences in urbanization and industrialization between catchment areas as one explanation for differences in observed plastic pollution. Some of the earlier studies in the Laurentian great lakes noted increased plastic levels in proximity to urban centers. The Swiss Litter Report 2018 noted that litter densities were higher in urban and suburban zones when compared to agricultural zones.

A recent study of Riverbank macrolitter in the Dutch Rhineâ€“Meuse delta also showed significant differences between three different catchment areas in the same region. The same study also listed fragmented plastics, fragmented foams, food wrappers, cigarette ends and cotton swabs in the twenty most abundant objects. The same objects are included in the most common objects for 2020 and were identified as the top-ten  by the SLR as well

### Associating land use to the most common objects

The most common objects represent $\approx 68$% of the all objects found. It is reasonable to assume that changes in the survey total would be in part due to changes in the amount of the most common objects found at any given survey. Too better understand the associations asserted above the Spearmans ranked correlation test was performed to test the hypothesis:

> Land use characteristics of survey locations can be associated with increasing or decreasing survey results of particular objects.

The most common objects are chosen for several reasons:

1. Objects that have a high fail rate appear in many surveys
2. It is likely that at least one of the most common was found at any survey

The most frequently identified and the most abundant object is the cigarette end. According to other studies including the SLR, cigarette ends are most prevalent in urban environments and can be linked to human activity in proximity to the survey location.


#### Significant associations

The test for association reveals that 3/4 of the objects that are associated with food or tobacco consumption have a positive association with buildings, recreation and streets. Glass drink bottle pieces are also associated with buildings and food consumption but positive associations with other land use features is inconclusive. Taken as a whole, these four objects make up 26% of all objects found and they were all found in at least 50% of all the surveys. Snack wrappers and cigarette ends also have the highest average p/50m rating of all the most common objects. **CONT refers to the group of food and tobacco objects that have a positive association with the percent of land attributed to buildings and are in the most common**.

These results support the idea that litter survey results increased when samples are considered with respect to the level of urbanization within 1500m of the survey location. This finding is consitent with the results of studies completed in Switzerland and elsewhere. 

> There is a positive relationship between urbanization and beach litter density in general. The positive relationship can be associated specifically to objects related to the consumption of food or tobacco if the amount of developed infrastructure is considered.

This concept has been widely adopted in practice, if not in theory. In general the more an area is developed the more resources are attributed to maintenance and upkeep, this includes trash removal and street sweeping.

#### Inconclusive assocciations

The test for association with buildings was inconclusive for 8/12 of the most common objects. These objects, which were identified earlier, represent a larger portion of the total objects found,  6/8 they were found in at least half of all the surveys. An inconclusive association suggests that these objects are found at approximately the same rate indifferent of the land use profile of the survey location. The primary use case or source for these objects was considered carefully, in the case of fragmented plastics no specific use case was assumed objects.

1. Expanded foams: repair and maintenance of infrastructure, insulation of building facades
2. Plastic construction waste: repair and maintenance of infrastructure
3. Industrial pellets: plastics less than 5mm
4. Expanded foams less than 5mm: plastics less than 5mm
5. Insulation, spray foams: repair and maintenance of infrastructure
6. Cotton bud sticks : waste-water
7. Industrial sheeting: aggriculture: under the denomination 'plasticulture'
8. Fragmented plastics: fragmented plastics greater than 5mm

Identifying the exact type of microplastics was outside the scope of this project, however visible objects less than 5mm were collected and counted as part of the survey. Industrial plastic pellets and expanded foam beads can be indentified accurately therefore they were counted seperately from other objects less than 5mm and included in the object totals.

Foams are lightweight and especially sensitive to wind and surface currents. Because of their low densities, these objects as well as cotton bud sticks stay on or near the surface of the water for extended periods of time untill the wind or waves push them to the shore. Industrial pellets are often found with algae or floating organic material. Fragmented plastics and plastic construction waste include a much wider range of polymers some of which are relatively dense. **DIST is used to refer to this group of abundant, diverse objects with no or few definitive land use associations and not related to food or tobacco**.


__Assessing the effects of hydrologic conditions__

The hydrologic conditions of rivers have an effect on the distance and direction that an object will travel. Large low density objects will most likely be transported to the next reservoir or area of reduced flow. Once in the area of reduced flow surface currents and wind will transport low density objects untill they degrade and sink or land on the shore, a few may make it to the next reservoir. High density objects will only be transported if the flow velocity and turbulence of the water are sufficient to keep the objects off the bottom. Once high density items enter a low velocity zone they tend to settle or sink.

For objects that are positively associated with a land use feature (CONT) **it is safe to assume that the  the survey location is acting as both a source and an accumulation zone for those objects**. Fluctuations in the quantities of CONT objects can be assumed and the negative effects reduced through planning. The temporary increases in street sweeping or trash removal durring festivals or outdoor gatherings is a practical example of anticipating and mitigating the fluctuations of CONT objects. 

For objects that are not associated with a land use feature (DIST) **probable accumulation zones or sources are, by definition, unknown**. The DIST objects are part of group of polymers and items whose quantities are missing from the *plastic budget* when the oceans are concerned. The distribution of these objects effects all locations and municipalities indifferent of the measured land use profile throughout all the survey areas. The survey results for these objects are best described in two ways:

1. Ubiquitous: few or no land use associations and a high fail rate, found at regular rates at the majority of the survey sites 
2. Transient : few or no land use associations and a low fail rate, found in significant quantities intermittently at specific locations

Seasonality is a common feature of litter survey results for all object groups. Implying that there is another force that is driving the seasonal increases and that force is **not accounted for by seasonal increases in economic acitvity near the survey locations**. Swiss rivers also have a distinct seasonality. While discharge rates are carefully monitored and lake levels carefully maintained the seasonal variations of snow melt and precipation are present. These changes can be quantified by using the discharge rate of the one land use feature that connects all survey locations in a survey area: the river.

The standard reporting unit for beach litter surveys is pieces per 100m which is big for many locations in the survey area. The standard is based on the marine environment where there are long stretches of homogeonous landscape and adequate space to allow for tidal fluctuations. In Switzerand the amount of land left for rivers and lakes is much smaller and the samples are smaller. The median survey length for 2020-2021 was 45 meters, therfore all results are reported in **pieces of trash for every 50 meters** (p/50m).

Unless there is a dominating lake current or unusual event high density items will tend to sink and settle close to where they entered a lake.

*Table notes: The totals are cumulative for each category. The total surface area was almost two hectares and the total shoreline was almost twenty kilometers. The average of pieces of trash per kilogram was 1,049 and the median was 446. The weights were taken on location at the time of the survey, there was no attempt to dry the objects prior to taking the weight.*
