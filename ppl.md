# Recycle and remake


Precious Plastic Léman [PPL](https://preciousplasticleman.ch/) is part of a global association that plays an active role locally to promote different methods to reuse and reduce plastic waste on Lake Geneva. Members of PPL took time out of their shchedule to collect thousands of pieces of trash as part of the IQAASL project. A small portion of those objects were recycled into new products. 

PPL members design, prototype and fabricate products from recycled plastics. The process has a several steps: 

* Collecting 
* Sorting 
* Cleaning 
* Transforming 
* Making 

As part of a feasibility study the members of PPL documented the fabrication process from start to finish using plastics gathered from the beach surveys. 

## Collecting 

PPL was responsible for three survey locations on Lac Léman and collected over 6,000 objects from the shores of the lake from April 2020 – May 2021. Members of PPL conducted litter surveys in all survey areas of Switzerland participating in the removal of over 50,000 items.  

## Sorting 

Different types of plastics have different properties. PPL takes care to not mix plastic types during the transforming and making of products. For objects where the type of plastic is not clearly indicated PPL uses FTIR technology to differentiate the plastic types.

A variety of plastics are encountered during a beach-litter survey. Not all of it can be transformed into products with added value. By identifying and grouping the plastics according to type, PPL can create objects best suited to the properties of the plastic being used.  

### Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 

The majority of PET found during the sampling period was in the form of drink bottles and food containers. However, most of the world's production of PET is used to produce fibers. PET is not well suited to the current fabrication process at PPL and therefore is not used.  

Only 88 PET drink bottles were recorded in the 2020-2021 survey. 

### High-density polyethylene (HDPE2) 

HDPE2 has a high strength-to-density ratio and works well in the PPL system. HDPE2 takes the form of many items that were identified during surveys:

* bottle lids 
* certain drink containers
* detergent and chemical containers 
* Toys

Combined there were 2,213 (4% of total) objects that could have been classified as HDPE. From these objects PPL makes key rings, flowerpots and carabiners.  

### Polyvinyl chloride (PVC3) 

PVC3 is a common material in construction plastics. Construction plastics are among the most common items on Lac Léman and nationally. Unfortunately, this product is toxic if not handled properly, PPL does not recycle this material. 

Plastic construction waste was identified in 52% of all samples and was $\approx$ 2% of all objects found 

### Low-density polyethylene (LDPE4) 

LDPE4 is not commonly recycled because it is either not labeled or very difficult to clean. LDPE4 is often classified under industrial sheeting or plastic bags.

Industrial sheeting was found in 69% of all samples and was $\approx$ 4% of all objects found

### Polypropylene (PP5) 

PP5 takes diverse forms when found on the beach. PP5 can be used in chip bags, buckets, medicine bottles, straws and even rope.  

PPL has found many uses for PP5 including pots, wall clocks, fresbees and  key rings.

PPL represents a large group of objects in a beach-litter inventory, combined with fragmented plastics PPL represents $\approx$ 16% of all objects found.

### Polystyrene (PS6) 

PS6 was found at almost all samples in either extruded or expanded form. PS6 can be recycled by PPL into rigid sheets of material that take a fine polish. 

Expanded and extruded polystyrene were found in 68% and 53% of all samples respectively. Combined they are responsible for at least 13% of all objects identified. 

### Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) 

ABS is light weight and can be injection molded or extruded. PPL use ABS and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) to make rigid recycled sheets.  

ABS is included with construction plastics during the inventory process 

## Cleaning

Once the objects are identified and sorted, they need to be cleaned before any transformation can occur. PPL used a combination of baking soda and vinegar with water remove the mud and dirt from the objects removed from the beach.

## Transforming 

The cleaned, sorted and dried plastics are shredded into granules that will then be injection molded.

## Making 

PP5 and HDPE2 are the most abundant objects from the litter surveys that also work well with the PPL system. Two types of products were produced from the plastics on Lac Léman.

## Discussion 

There was an abundance of reusable material found on the shores of the lakes that PPL sampled as part of the IQAASL project. However, collecting and washing the objects by hand is not a business model that can be pursued. PPL would rather see collection points for plastics that can be reused and recycled locally. 

Cleaning plastics before recycling can be costly and wasteful. Large scale recycling plants have water treatment facilities to remove the detergents and impurities that result from the cleaning process. In this example baking soda and vinegar was used, appropriate for a small run but not a method that can be scaled.  

The amount of plastics that can be collected and transformed into value added products during the sampling process is symbolic at best. At present there is no plans to increase the efficiency of beach-litter surveys in that regard. It may be more appropriate to catch the materials before they are found on the beach. 

The presence of easily recyclable products in the water is a sign that there are missed opportunities with respect to valuing this resource and/or collecting it prior to leaking into the environment. Fragmented plastics, foams and bottle caps can all be recycled locally using the methods implemented at Precious Plastic. Combined these objects represent approximately 26% of the total amount collected on the beach in 2020-2021.
