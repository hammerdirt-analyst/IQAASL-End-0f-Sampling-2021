The recommended minimum number of surveys (40) per sampling period is to ensure that BV calculations are based on a sufficient number of samples, this is important because of the high variability of beach litter surveys. 

The sampling period for IQAASL was April through May 2020 - 2021. With respect to the minimum number of samples there are three baseline values for the Aare survey area:

1. Bielersee
2. Neuenburgersee
3. The Aare survey area

For assessment purposes this means that one sample can serve as a spot assessment and the results can be compared to any of the regional baselines directly, providing instant feedback. This type of assessment simplifies the process and empowers local stakeholders to carry out independent assessments, draw conclusions and define mitigation strategies based on the results of the established BV for the survey area.

In the previous examples no threshold values or extreme values are indicated. Values greater than zero are the expected median amount of that object for every measured unit, a zero value indicates that the object was found in less than 50% of the surveys. The percentile ranking for a particular object can be inferred by reading the table of values in the horizontal direction.

How meaningful these results are to the assessment of mitigation strategies depends on the number and quality of samples. Stakeholders at the municipal or local level need detailed data about specific objects. While national and international stakeholders tend to use broader aggregated groups.

The quality of the data is directly related to the training and support of the surveyors. The identification process is long at first and many objects are not familiar to the _average person_. Encouraging meetings between surveyors and having a core team to assist in the development and training ensures that the surveys are conducted consistently over time.

The monitoring program in Switzerland has managed to keep pace with developments on the continent, there are however many areas of improvement:

1. Defining a standardized reporting method for municipal, cantonal and federal stakeholders
2. Define monitoring or assessment goals
3. Formalize the data repository and the method for implementation at different administrative levels
4. Develop a network of associations that share the responsibility of surveying the territory
5. Develop and implement a formal training program for surveyors
6. Determine, in collaboration with academic partners, ideal sampling scenarios and research needs

Changes in beach-litter survey results are signals, using baseline values helps identify the magnitude of those signals. However, without any context or additional information changes may appear random. Expert judgement includes the ability to place survey results in the context of local events and topography. This capacity of discernment with regards to the data and the environment it was collected in is part of identifying potential sources and priorities.
