# Calculating beach litter baseline values

Baseline values (BVs), sometimes referred to as _benchmarks_, are the quantities or values that are used to define a situation statistically.
The BVs refer to a set of data that has both temporal and geographical limits, sometimes referred to as a *reference point* or *baseline period*
, BVs are the quantities against which progress is measured. In this regard, BVs are intimately linked to the data and the methods used to collect
it.

## Counting beach litter: an overview

The first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published in 2008 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) {cite}`unepseas`. Based on the accumulated work of many scientists, this method was
reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010 {cite}`ospard10`, and in 2013 the EU released _Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas_ 
(_the guide_) {cite}`mlwguidance`. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in _the guide_.

_The guide_ was followed by _Riverine Litter Monitoring - Options and Recommendations_ in 2016 {cite}`riverinemonitor`, reflecting the mounting evidence that
rivers are important sources of household waste in coastal regions. By that time the initial beach litter surveillance project on Lac LÃ©man
had run its course and preparations were on the way for a year long national project in Switzerland initiated by STOPPP and supported by WWF volunteers
, see [_More and less trash since 2017_](slr-iqaasl).

In 2019 the Joint Research Centre (JRC) released an _Analysis of a pan-European 2012-2016 beach litter dataset_ , a technical document that
detailed the methods and different scenarios for calculating baseline values from beach litter data. Of particular interest to the JRC was the
robustness of methods to extreme values and transparency of the calculation method. {cite}`eubaselines`

Finally, in September 2020 the EU established baseline and target values based on the data collected from 2015-2016. The target values relate to the 
Good Environmental Status of marine waters described by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and the baselines were calculated using the methods described
in the 2019 publication. {cite}`threshholdeu`

### Switzerland 2020

The IQAASL project started in April 2020, recycling many of the locations sampled in 2017 and establishing new locations throughout the
defined survey areas. Similar to survey results in the marine environment beach-litter-data in Switzerland is highly variable. With values
ranging from zero to thousands of objects and fragments within 100m of river or lake shoreline.

## Calculating baselines

The methods described in sections 3 and 4 of _A European Threshold Value and Assessment Method for Macro Litter on Coastlines_ and sections 6, 7 and 8
from _Analysis of a pan-European 2012-2016 beach litter dataset_  are applied to the beach litter survey results from April 2020 to May 2021.

The different options for calculating baselines, determining confidence intervals and identifying extreme values are explained and examples are given.
