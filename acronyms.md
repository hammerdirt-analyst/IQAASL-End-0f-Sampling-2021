# Executive summary
Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL)

## Project overview scope
IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify visible shoreline litter along Swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale litter surveys were completed at various locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and related lakes and rivers. Included in this report are litter surveys conducted in the Swiss alps. The IQAASL project included an onboarding process of associations and groups. The Alpes survey area is a series of litter-surveys configured and managed by the Summit Foundation which conducts clean up events throughout the Swiss Alpes. See the full report [Les Alpes](lesalpes) 

This report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020 to July 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) [Bla18], the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the Guide to monitoring beach litter [Han13].  
The methodology and protocols follow the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to ensure the data collected is transparent, harminous and coherent with the current objectives and strategies developed by The Marine Directors of the European Union (EU), acceding countries, candidate countries and EFTA countries. 


Swiss lakes are at relatively low elevation for many river basins, this project aimed to identify and quantify concentrations of discarded objects that may be transported and accumulating in the lakes as well as directly deposited along the shores of regional lakes. There were 20 sites selected from 7 different lakes from 3 major river basins to survey monthly for a year with the exception of Lago Maggiore sites, which were surveyed trimonthly for a year to capture seasonal variations. Of the twenty sites, ten have previous litter data available, all sites with the exception of Lac Léman have location(s) with no previously recorded data.

Lakes surveyed:
    Thunersee
    Bielersee
    Neuenburgersee
    Zurichsee
    Lac Léman
    Walensee
    Lago Maggiore

## Methods and protocols
In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) [eall09]. This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010 [OSP17]. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (the guide) [Han13]. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in this guide and Riverine Litter Monitoring - Options and Recommendations in 2016 [HGFT+17] that accounts for rivers as an important source of coastal pollution.

In brief, a shoreline survey area is defined by the GPS point and the survey dimensions recorded. The length and width are measured for each survey. The minimum width is the distance between the waters edge and the strandline. All visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, weighed and counted. For this project all plastic items were weighed separately. Item classification was based on the code definitions from the Marine Strategy Framework (MSFD) _master list_ {cite}`mlwguidance`. To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For the complete list of item identification codes and definitions see [Code groups](codegroups).
