# Executive summary
Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for
the Environment to quantify visible shoreline litter along Swiss lakes and rivers. The project was expanded to include twenty
locations in the Alps and Jura. The results from the Alps and Jura are considered separately from the analysis of the results 
from lakes and rivers.

## Assessement method

A beach-litter survey is the __accounting of all the man made objects found on the ground within a delimited area__ that is bordered on one side by a lake or river. In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (_The guide_) {cite}`mlwguidance`. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in _The guide_.

A beach-litter survey is defined by the GPS point and the survey dimensions recorded. The length and width are measured for each survey. The minimum width is the distance between the waters edge and the strandline. All visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, weighed and counted. For this project all plastic items were weighed separately. Item classification was based on the code definitions included in _The guide_. 

To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For example, codes were developed for items such as _pheromone bait containers_ and _ski poles_ to anticipate the occurence of these objects when surveys are conducted within certain regions. This feature, which allows researchers and stakeholders to account for specific items is essential in identifying probable sources and defining reduction strategies. For the complete list of item identification codes and definitions see [Code groups](codegroups).

## Assesment metric

The median value ($50^{th}$ percentile) of the survey results are reported as _number of objects per 100m_ (p/100m) of shore line. This is the method described in _EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines_ and is the standard used in this report. 

The 100 meter standard used in the marine environment is appropriate for coastal regions of the European continent, however in the sub-alpine and urban environments that characterize the surveys in IQAASL imposing the 100 meter standard would have reduced the number of appropriate survey locations. Thus, surveyors are permitted to do surveys that are appropriate to the local topography, however surveys less than 10m were not considered in the baseline analysis.

The median value was selected as opposed to the average value because of the variability of beach litters surveys and the effects of extreme values on the aggregated survey results {cite}`eubaselines`. The median value is more robust when the extreme values are considered.

### Zero values

It is common that a particular item or object will have a median value of zero at one aggregation level and not the other. This particularity is __extremely useful when identifying items that were found the most frequently and where they were found in the greatest numbers__.

Therefore, if the median is zero for an object at a particular aggregation level it means that the object was found in less than half of all surveys for that aggregation level and geographic definition.

## Lakes and rivers

For the period between 2020-03 and 2021-05 54,744 objects were removed and identified in the course of 386 surveys. The survey areas were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers.Those surveys were conducted at 143 different locations. There are 77 different municipalities represented with a combined population of approximately 1,735,991 including Geneva and Zurich.

### Median survey total

The median survey total of the 386 surveys was 189 p/100m. The maximum recorded was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare suvey area). The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total (442), this can in part be explained by the high number of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and by the deposition of fragmented plastics and foams at the Rhône out fall in the region of the the Haut Lac.

A reference value was calculated using the method described in _EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines_. This method excludes objects less than 2.5cm and surveys less than 10 meters.

### The most common objects

The most common objects are defined as those objects that were found in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent $\approx$ 68% of all objects found in the sampling period.



t is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020 to July 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) [Bla18], the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the Guide to monitoring beach litter [Han13].

The methodology and protocols follow the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to ensure the data collected is transparent, harminous and coherent with the current objectives and strategies developed by The Marine Directors of the European Union (EU), acceding countries, candidate countries and EFTA countries. 

Swiss lakes are at relatively low elevation for many river basins, this project aimed to identify and quantify concentrations of discarded objects that may be transported and accumulating in the lakes as well as directly deposited along the shores of regional lakes. There were 20 sites selected from 7 different lakes from 3 major river basins to survey monthly for a year with the exception of Lago Maggiore sites, which were surveyed trimonthly for a year to capture seasonal variations. Of the twenty sites, ten have previous litter data available, all sites with the exception of Lac Léman have location(s) with no previously recorded data.

    Bielersee
    Neuenburgersee
    Zurichsee
    Lac Léman

## Methods and protocols

In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) [eall09]. This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010 [OSP17]. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (the guide) [Han13]. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in this guide and Riverine Litter Monitoring - Options and Recommendations in 2016 [HGFT+17] that accounts for rivers as an important source of coastal pollution. The complete litter collection protocols documents are available at https://www.plagespropres.ch/.

In brief, a shoreline survey area is defined by the GPS point and the survey dimensions recorded. The length and width are measured for each survey. The minimum width is the distance between the waters edge and the strandline. All visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, weighed and counted. For this project all plastic items were weighed separately. Item classification was based on the code definitions from the Marine Strategy Framework (MSFD) _master list_ {cite}`mlwguidance`. To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For the complete list of item identification codes and definitions see [Code groups](codegroups).
