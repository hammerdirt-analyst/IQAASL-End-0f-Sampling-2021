# Executive summary
Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL)

## Project Overview
IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify visible shoreline litter along Swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale litter surveys were completed at various locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and related lakes and rivers. Included in this report are litter surveys conducted in the Swiss alps. The IQAASL project included an onboarding process of associations and groups. The Alpes survey area is a series of litter-surveys configured and managed by the Summit Foundation which conducts clean up events throughout the Swiss Alpes. See the full report [Les Alpes](lesalpes) 

This report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020 to July 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) [Bla18], the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the Guide to monitoring beach litter [Han13].  
The methodology and protocols follow the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to ensure the data collected is transparent, harminous and coherent with the current objectives and strategies developed by The Marine Directors of the European Union (EU), acceding countries, candidate countries and EFTA countries. 

## Project scope
Swiss lakes are at relatively low elevation for many river basins, this project aimed to identify and quantify concentrations of discarded objects that may be transported and accumulating in the lakes as well as directly deposited along the shores of regional lakes. There were 20 sites selected from 7 different lakes from 3 major river basins to survey monthly for a year with the exception of Lago Maggiore sites, which were surveyed trimonthly for a year to capture seasonal variations. Of the twenty sites, ten have previous litter data available, all sites with the exception of Lac Léman have location(s) with no previously recorded data.

Lakes surveyed:
    Thunersee
    Bielersee
    Neuenburgersee
    Zurichsee
    Lac Léman
    Walensee
    Lago Maggiore

## Methods and protocols
A shoreline survey area is defined by the GPS point and the survey dimensions recorded. The minimum width is the distance between the waters edge and the strandline. In some cases the strandline and the back of the beach may be the same. For more information on how the survey areas are measured see The land use profile.
All the visible objects within the survey area are collected, classified and counted. The plastic objects and objects less than 5mm are weighed separately. Classification is based on the current code definitions which is based on the master list of codes in The Guide. Specific objects that are of particular local interest have been added under G9xx and G7xx.
The length and width of the survey area is measured at each survey. Thus the number of items can be reported in a standard unit indifferent of the survey locations. In this report the standard reporting unit recommended by the EU is used: pieces of trash per 100 meters.
