# Executive summary
Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for
the Environment to quantify visible shoreline litter along Swiss lakes and rivers. The project was expanded to include twenty
locations in the Alps and Jura. The results from the Alps and Jura are considered separately from the analysis of the results 
from lakes and rivers.


## Assesment metric

The median value of the survey results are reported as _number of objects per 100m_ (p/100m). This is the method described in _EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines_ and
is the standard used in this report. The data was collected according to _Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas_, specifically:

1. The length and width of a section of river bank or lake shore was measured, and all objects were removed and counted

Surveyors are permitted to do surveys that are appropriate to the size of the local topography, however surveys less than 10m were not considered in the baseline analysis. Unless specifically mentioned the median values is that of __all counted objects__ including visible objects less than 5mm. 

## Lakes and rivers

For the period between 2020-03 and 2021-05, 54,744 objects were removed and identified in the course of 386 surveys. The survey areas were defined by the Aare,
Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers.Those surveys were conducted at 143 different locations. There are 77 different municipalities represented with a combined population of approximately 1,735,991 including Geneva and Zurich.


The median survey result was 181 pieces per 100 meters (p/100m), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147p/100m - 213p/100m. This represents 54,337 objects or ≈
306kg including 95kg of plastic. The total linear distance surveyed was ≈ 20 km with a surface area of 9 hectares. Both Geneva and Zurich are included putting the total municipal population with a stake in this report at 1.7 million.
IQAASL 
Multiple small scale litter surveys were completed at various locations within a designated survey area.  As part of the on The Alpes survey area is a series of litter-surveys
configured and managed by the Summit Foundation which conducts clean up events throughout the Swiss Alpes. See the full report [Les Alpes](lesalpes) 

This report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020 to July 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) [Bla18], the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the Guide to monitoring beach litter [Han13].  
The methodology and protocols follow the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to ensure the data collected is transparent, harminous and coherent with the current objectives and strategies developed by The Marine Directors of the European Union (EU), acceding countries, candidate countries and EFTA countries. 

Swiss lakes are at relatively low elevation for many river basins, this project aimed to identify and quantify concentrations of discarded objects that may be transported and accumulating in the lakes as well as directly deposited along the shores of regional lakes. There were 20 sites selected from 7 different lakes from 3 major river basins to survey monthly for a year with the exception of Lago Maggiore sites, which were surveyed trimonthly for a year to capture seasonal variations. Of the twenty sites, ten have previous litter data available, all sites with the exception of Lac Léman have location(s) with no previously recorded data.


Lakes surveyed:
    Thunersee
    Bielersee
    Neuenburgersee
    Zurichsee
    Lac Léman
    Walensee
    Lago Maggiore

## Methods and protocols
In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) [eall09]. This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010 [OSP17]. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (the guide) [Han13]. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in this guide and Riverine Litter Monitoring - Options and Recommendations in 2016 [HGFT+17] that accounts for rivers as an important source of coastal pollution. The complete litter collection protocols documents are available at https://www.plagespropres.ch/.

In brief, a shoreline survey area is defined by the GPS point and the survey dimensions recorded. The length and width are measured for each survey. The minimum width is the distance between the waters edge and the strandline. All visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, weighed and counted. For this project all plastic items were weighed separately. Item classification was based on the code definitions from the Marine Strategy Framework (MSFD) _master list_ {cite}`mlwguidance`. To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For the complete list of item identification codes and definitions see [Code groups](codegroups).

Application
    
Included in this report are litter surveys conducted in the Swiss alps. The IQAASL project included an onboarding process of associations and groups. The Alpes survey area is a series of litter-surveys configured and managed by the Summit Foundation which conducts clean up events throughout the Swiss Alpes.
