# Executive summary

Identification, quantification and analysis of anthropogenic Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project commissioned by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to collect data concerning visible pollutants along Swiss lakes and rivers. All discarded materials were collected and identified using litter survey techniques. The project was expanded to include 20 locations in the Alps and Jura, in total there were 406 samples from 163 locations in 95 municipalities.
    
This report is a summary and analysis of the litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from March 2020 through August 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR){cite}`slr`, the last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the _Guide to monitoring beach litter_ {cite}`mlwguidance` or any other comparable method.

## Lakes and rivers

The lakes and rivers were sampled from 2020-03 through 2021-05, a total of 54,744 objects were removed and classified over the course of 386 surveys. The survey locations were divided into survey areas for regional analysis and defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers. Surveys were conducted at 143 different locations, representing 77 municipalities. The total linear distance surveyed was  approximately 20 km with a surface area of 9 hectares and a total municipal population of 1.7 million. 

Most surveys were along lake shorelines (331 samples) as lakes offer more consistent and safe year-round access with respect to rivers. Additionally, lakes are large areas of reduced flow that receive input from multiple rivers, streams and drainage systems providing ideal locations to assess the variety of objects in and around the water bodies. 

In total 316 samples came from seven principal lakes in 3 major river basins. Twenty locations were selected to sample monthly for a twelve-month period with the exception of Lago Maggiore, which was sampled every three months. Surveys were also conducted on Lago di Lugano, Lac des Quatre cantons, Brienzersee and Zugersee. In addition, there were 55 surveys on 16 rivers.

### Median survey total

The results are in units of pieces of litter per 100 meters (p/100m). The median survey result of all data was approximately 189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare survey area). The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed plastics at the Rhône River out flow in the upper lake region. 

A reference value was calculated excluding the results from samples that were less than 10m and objects less than 2.5cm. This method, described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines {cite}`eubaselines` was used to establish the __95% confidence interval (CI) of 147 - 213p/100m for the the median survey result of 180p/100m in Switzerland__. The results from the European baseline value lie outside this range, 131p/100m. 

Surveys in Switzerland were on average, smaller scale than in marine environments and in locations that would be considered urban under most circumstances. To date monitoring of lakes and rivers upstream of coastal regions has not generalized on the European continent. However, there is a concerted effort by a group of associations in Switzerland and France to establish a common monitoring and data exchange protocol for the Rhône basin. Additionally, the Wageningen University & Research has begun analyzing data collected in the Meusse - Rhine delta using protocols like those in IQAASL {cite}`meuserhine`.

### The most common objects

The most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent 68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. Of the most common items 27% are food, drink and tobacco related and 24% are infrastructure and agriculture related.  

Objects related to food, drink and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage of land attributed to buildings or fixed infrastructure, the inverse is true of the locations with a higher percentage of land attributed to woods or agriculture. However, infrastructure material and fragmented plastics, are found at similar rates throughout all survey areas indifferent of land use surrounding the survey locations.

{numref}`Figure {number}: <esummarymcommon>` _Survey totals all lakes and rivers: the most common objects identified from March 2020 - May 2021. The fail rate is the ratio of the number of times an object was identified at least once with respect to the number of surveys. The quantity is the total number of an identified object collected and the median pieces of litter per 100 meters (p/100m)._ 

For example, figure 2, a total of 8,485 cigarette filters were identified in 87% of the surveys, representing 15 percent of the total items collected and had a median value of 20 cigarette filters per 100m of shoreline.

Industrial pellets and expanded foams < 5mm both occurred in significant quantities but identified in less than 50% of the surveys (median of 0), indicating high counts at specific locations. While both micro-plastics, their use, origin and rate of occurrence are different depending on the survey area region. Industrial pellets are raw materials used in injection molding processes and foamed plastic beads are the result of fragmentation of expanded polystyrene.

## Trends from 2017-2018

Similar lake and river survey data collected in 2017-2018 (SLR) showed no statistical difference when compared to IQAASL results. However, there were variances in object quantities. In the 2020-2021 survey period fewer cigarettes, bottle tops and glass fragments and more cotton swab sticks, industrial sheeting and plastic construction waste was identified.

## The Alps and the Jura

Of the twenty surveys in the Alps survey area 17 met the length and width criteria of greater than 10m. The median survey value was 110 p/100m, less than the median value of all the other survey areas (189 p/100m). Objects related to consumption such as food and drink or tobacco were a smaller percent of the total and had a lower p/100m rate compared to the results from shoreline locations. This difference could be in part due to the low levels of urbanization that characterizes the Alps survey area with respect to all other survey areas and the tendency of material to flow downstream.

## Communicating results

For communicating pollution quantities, converting results into a simple metric of average pieces per 100m is useful as the average is generally larger and rarely 0. However, the average maybe twice the median when extreme values are considered `causing confusion regarding the difference between observed and reported results`. Communicating the range of likely values or the likelihood of finding an object is more informative and repeatable when following similar protocols. For example, when interpretating the quantities of industrial pellets identified on Lac Léman:

>There were 1’387 GPI or 5% of all objects identified on Lac Léman. The number of pellets per 100m ranges from 0 -1033 depending on the region. For the lake in general there is a approximately a 40% chance of finding at least one pellet at a survey, anywhere. In some locations Genève (60% chance) or Préverenges (80% chance) production pellets are regular features on these beaches, amounts between 3p/100m and 56p/100m are common.

## Conclusions

Count methods are preferred for assessing litter composition and density in marine environments although, a methodology has not been standardized for freshwater systems. Currently three of the four survey areas in the IQAASL are actively monitored by research and governmental agencies downstream of Switzerland using similar methods presented in this report. Additionally, regional associations in Switzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner NGOs in the EU.   

There is broad-based support for this type of reporting method. The IQAASL is a citizen-science project that only uses open-source tools and shares data on GNU public license, enabling collaboration with stakeholders at all levels. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, Hammerdirt will assume the responsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.  

The associations that participated in the IQAASL are actively seeking ways to incorporate the data collection process and/or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional associations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most.  

## Recommendations

### Monitoring and reporting

Efficiencies in data exchange and reporting would be realized immediately by defining a standard reporting format. This in turn would make it easier for regional administrations to communicate priorities to other stakeholders. Which would facilitate monitoring strategies and help define reduction targets. 

> Develop a network of associations that are responsible for sampling and reporting of the results.

> Create a standard report format to facilitate communications between municipal, cantonal and regional/district administrations and improve coordination of regional and local reduction strategies. 

> Establish the next sampling period or the interval of sampling. 

Formally include academia in the planning, sampling and analysis. This project was influenced with collaborative university professors from ETH, UNIGE, EPFL, PSI and FHNW. University partners would be ideal to continue developing analytical methods. The Citizen Science Center (ETH) and Citizen Cyberlab (UNIGE) have the experience and infrastructure to connect citizen science monitoring projects to research efforts. 

### Elimination and reduction

Strategies for eliminating or reducing trash in the water should first consider the source.

__Objects associated with land use features__

The results indicate a positive association between the number of buildings and the amount of food, drink and tobacco items. This suggests that reduction strategies for these objects should begin in areas that have high concentrations of infrastructure in proximity to the shoreline. The results from the Rhône survey area suggests that local awareness campaigns may have a positive effect see Figure 1.9 [_Lakes and rivers_](allsurveys). __If all objects related to food, drink and tobacco were eliminated from the surveys 64% of the objects would still remain.__

* Other common reduction strategies include: 
  * Adequate supply of weather and animal resistant trash receptacles 
  * Increased trash removal and sweeping schedule 
  * Single use plastic reductions 

Many countries have begun restricting targeted items. For example, single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds cannot be placed on the markets of the EU Member States, effective 3 July 2021.  Retaining nets to filter litter in stormwater systems before it enters lake and rivers has been used in France with success but requires investment in infrastructure, equipment and labor. 

There are products on the market made to filter out trash after it enters the stormwater system but before it enters the lake or river. The system of retaining nets has been fielded in France with success but does require investments in infrastructure, equipment and labor. 

__Objects not associated with land use__

Objects that do not have a positive association with land use require a coordinated action at least at the level of the lake or river, and all locations upstream from intended survey locations. Of the most common objects these include: 

* Fragmented plastics
* Fragmented foams
* Construction plastics
* Industrial pellets
* Cotton swabs
* Industrial sheeting

These objects are approximately 40% of all identified material. Many have industrial and personal hygiene applications, typically not associated with beach activities. Expanding awareness campaigns targeting internal material loss prevention from specific sectors may reduce objects such as industrial pellets used for plastic injection molding. Some objects such as plastic cotton swabs and other toilet flushed plastics enter lakes and rivers via water treatment facilities.   

Reduction strategies may include:

* Upgrading wastewater treatment facilities to reduce material loss 
* Awareness campaigns for specific objects or products 
* Awareness campaigns for specific industries 

Elimination or reduction strategies requires coordinated regional action to include the communities upstream from survey locations. 

Reducing reliance on single use plastics, foamed plastics, construction plastics and industrial sheeting and films would likely greatly reduce the quantities escaping into the natural environment. The low cost and disposable nature of these materials have resulted in an ever-increasing abundance and reliance in all sectors. The lightweight and degradable attributes of these materials facilitate fragmentation and absconding into the natural systems especially with prolonged outdoor exposure. Plastic pollutants are a global problem and increasingly nations are reducing reliance on single use plastics and foamed plastics such as polystyrene.
