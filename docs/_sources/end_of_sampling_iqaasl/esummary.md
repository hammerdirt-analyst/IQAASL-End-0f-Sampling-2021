# Executive summary

Identification, quantification and analysis of Swiss litter (IQAASL) is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to collect data concerning visible pollutants along Swiss lakes and rivers. All of the discarded materials were collected and identified using beach litter survey techniques. The sampling period was 2020-03 through 2021-05 a total of 54,744 objects were removed and classified in the course of 386 surveys. The survey locations were divided into survey areas that were defined by the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers. Surveys were conducted at 143 different locations, representing 77 municipalities with a combined population of approximately 1,735,991.

## Assessement method

In 2008 the first international guide to collecting beach-litter data was published by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) {cite}`unepseas`. This method was reproduced by the OSPAR Commission in 2010 {cite}`ospard10`. In 2013 the EU released Guidance on Monitoring of Marine Litter in European Seas (The guide) {cite}`mlwguidance`. Switzerland is a member of OSPAR and has over 1,500 samples using the methods described in _The guide_. 

*A beach-litter survey is the accounting of visible anthropogenic material identified within a delimited area that is bordered on one side by a lake, river or ocean.*

* Locations are defined by their GPS points 
* Length and width are measured for each survey area 
* Visible pollutants within the survey area are collected, classified, counted and weighed
* All items are classified based on code definitions included in _The guide_.

To identify objects of regional interest supplementary codes were added. For example, codes were developed for items such as _pheromone bait containers_ and _ski poles_ to account for the occurrence of these objects when identified in certain regions. Identifying and quantifying items allows researchers and stakeholders to determine probable sources and define reduction strategies targeting specific items.

## Lakes and rivers

The majority of the surveys were lake side (331 samples). Lakes offer a more consistent and safe survey environment with respect to rivers. In addition, lakes are large areas of reduced flow that receive input from multiple rivers, streams and drainage systems. As such lakes provide ideal locations to assess the variety of objects in the water.

In total 316 samples came from seven principal lakes in 3 major river basins. Twenty locations were selected to sample monthly for a twelve-month period with the exception of Lago Maggiore which was sampled every three months. There were 222 surveys at these locations with a total of 37,406 objects removed and identified. Surveys were also conducted on Lago di Lugano, Lac des Quatre cantons, Brienzersee and Zugersee. In addition there were 55 surveys on 16 rivers. The median survey total was 75p/100m for 2,475 objects removed from river shorelines.

## Assessment metric

The median value ($50^{th}$ percentile) of the survey results is reported as number of objects per 100m (p/100m) of shore line. This is the method described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines {cite}`eubaselines` and is the standard used in this report. The 100-meter shoreline standard used in the marine environment is appropriate for coastal regions of the European continent. However urbanization and topography present unique challenges when selecting locations suitable to safely conduct yearlong shoreline litter surveys. 

Limiting surveys to 100 meters of exposed shoreline would have dramatically reduced the number of available survey locations as well as the use of preexisting data. Thus, the IQAASL reflects local topography with a median survey length of 45m, and an average of 51m. Surveys less than 10m were not considered in the baseline analysis. 

### Median survey total

The median survey value was selected due to the variability of litter surveys and the effects of extreme values on aggregated results{cite}`eubaselines`. An object may have have a median value of zero at one aggregation level and not the other. This particularity is extremely useful to determine the location and frequency of identified items.

The median survey total of the 386 surveys was 189 p/100m. The maximum recorded value was 6,617 p/100m (Rhône survey area) and the minimum recorded was 2p/100m (Aare suvey area). The Rhône survey area had the highest median survey total of 442p/100m, this can in part be explained by the high number of urban survey locations with respect to the other survey areas and the deposition of fragmented plastics and foamed plastics at the Rhône river out flow in the upper lake region.

A reference value was calculated excluding the results from samples that were less than 10m and objects less than 2.5cm. This method, described in EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines{cite}`eubaselines` was used to calculate the reference and threshold values for all European beaches in 2015 and 2016 resulting in a median value of 131 p/100m. The results from the European baseline value lie outside the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 147 - 213p/100m established using the data from IQAASL.

Surveys in Switzerland are on average shorter than surveys in the marine environment and in locations that would be considered urban under most circumstances. To date monitoring of lakes and rivers upstream of coastal regions has not generalized on the European continent. However, there is a concerted effort by a group of associations in Suisse Romande and France to establish a common monitoring and data exchange protocol for the Rhône basin. The Wageningen University & Research has begun analyzing data collected in the Meusse - Rhine delta using protocols similar to those in IQAASL {cite}`meuserhine`.

### The most common objects

The most common objects are defined as those objects identified in at least 50% of all surveys and/or are among the ten most abundant by quantity. As a group the most common objects represent 68% of all objects identified in the sampling period. Of the most common items identified 27% are food and tobacco related and 24% are infrastructure and agriculture related. 

Objects related to food and tobacco are identified at higher rates at survey locations with a greater percentage of land attributed to buildings or fixed infrastructure, the inverse is true of the locations with a higher percentage of land attributed to woods or agriculture. However, objects related to infrastructure and fragmented plastics, are found at $\approx$ rates throughout all survey areas indifferent of land use surrounding the survey locations.

Two of the most common objects were identified in less than 50% of the surveys. This indicates that they had high counts at the surveys they were identified in. Both are less than 5mm in diameter and are considered micro-plastics. _Industrial pellets_ were identified in all survey areas. The highest rates were recorded at Préverenges, Genève, Lugano and Biel. _Expanded foams < 5mm_ are the result of the fragmentation of expanded polystyrene and at times were identified in large quantities.

The most common objects are found at different rates depending on the survey area, lake and in some cases the land-use conditions. As a result, regional priorities may be different.

### Comparing 2017-2018 and 2020-2021 survey results

Considering only the lakes and rivers that have data in both 2018 and 2020 sampling periods more samples and more objects were collected from fewer locations in 2018 than 2020. However, on a pieces per meter basis the mean, median and maximum were all higher in 2020. The summary statistics and the results of the difference of means test implies there was not a measurable change on the national scale from one sampling period to the other.
The 95% CI of the median survey total in 2020 was 137 - 188p/100m. The median result for 2018 was 125p/100m with a 95% CI of 112p/100m to 146p/100m, which includes the lower bound of the median from 2020. 

The difference of means for the most common objects suggest a more realistic and dynamic result:

There was a slight decrease in litter items associated with behavior:

* cigarette ends
* metal bottle caps
* glass bottles

There was a slight increase in other items:

* industrial sheeting
* plastic construction waste
* other plastic and foam products
* cotton swabs

The decrease in tobacco and food related products is likely the result of pandemic related restrictions that marked 2020. Increases of industrial sheeting, plastic construction waste and other plastic foam products or cotton swabs cannot be attributed to a specific event.

These results suggest that perceived local decreases in litter quantities were likely the result of decline in usage of facilities as opposed to a sweeping change in behavior. Consequently, the survey results for items associated with behavior will likely return to 2018 levels or greater as pandemic related restrictions are relaxed and usage patterns return to normal.

## The Alps and the Jura

Of the twenty surveys in the Alps survey area 17 met the length and width criteria of greater than 10m. The median survey value was 110 p/100m, less than the median value of all the other survey areas (189 p/100m). Objects related to consumption such as food and drink or tobacco were a smaller percent of the total and had a lower p/100m rate compared to the results from shoreline locations. This difference could be in part due to the low levels of urbanization that characterizes the Alps survey area with respect to all other survey areas and the tendency of material to flow downstream. The results from the Alps and Jura are considered separately from the analysis of the results from lakes and rivers and discussed further in: *The Alps and the Jura* section.

## Communicating results

The median survey result can create challenges for organizations that are attempting to raise awareness. The desire is to convert the survey results into a simple metric such as average pieces per 100m. For communicating pollution quantities, it is more interesting as the average is never zero. However, the average maybe twice the median when extreme values are considered, `which could create confusion about the difference between observed and reported results`.

Both methods are correct mathematically. The average value will mostly likely be larger but `the median value is a better approximation of what a sample may look like if the experiment was repeated`. This concept is central to most monitoring systems based on count data and is a measure of repeatability.

For communications purposes the total quantity by region or the percent of total may be the easiest method. Using the more precise p/100m rating for specific examples. Consider this interpretation of the amounts of industrial pellets (GPI) found on Lac Léman.

>There were 1’387 GPI or 5% of all objects identified on Lac Léman. The number of pellets per 100m ranges from 1-1006 depending on the region. For the lake in general there is a 40% chance of finding at least one pellet at a survey. In some locations like Genève, Préverenges, St. Sulpice and Vidy the chances of finding at least one pellet is 90% and the number found is between 3p/100m and 105p/100m.

Communicating the range of likely values and the locations where they may be found is much more precise and informative. A proposed solution is to include the average p/100m with the summary values. This would allow stakeholders a value that is perhaps easier to communicate but can always be referenced within the context of the median value. 
 
## Conclusions

Count methods remain the preferred method for assessing litter composition and density along the shoreline. Although there is no standard method on the continent for assessing the litter in fresh water systems all indications are that this will soon change. 

Three of the four survey areas already have active monitoring by research and governmental agencies downstream of Switzerland. The methods used are similar to those presented in this report. Regional associations in Switzerland are actively pursuing a standardization of reporting and protocols with partner organizations in the EU. 

On a national scale the survey results remain stable with respect to 2018. However, there was a general decrease in the quantity of food and tobacco objects and an increase in the amount of infrastructure related items. The pandemic related restrictions may have had a beneficial effect on survey results of food and tobacco items. The increases in infrastructure related objects were felt most acutely in Valais and Vaud from the Rhône outfall and in Brienze from the Aare outfall to Brienzersee.

The land use around a survey location has a measurable effect on the deposition of certain objects. The more buildings and fixed infrastructure there are the more tobacco and food products are found. Objects like fragmented plastics and industrial sheeting do not have the same association and are found at approximately equal rates indifferent of the land use with increases near river/canal discharge points.

There is an emphasis in the Lac Léman region on public awareness and the reduction of littering. This is perhaps the reason why the Rhône survey area is the only survey area where infrastructure related objects are more numerous than food and drink objects. Which implies that awareness campaigns for the other most common objects may also have a beneficial effect. 

If all objects related to food and tobacco were eliminated there would still be 64% of the trash left on the beach. Organizations will need to develop innovative strategies to reduce the amounts of the other objects.

There is broad-based support for this type of reporting method. This remains a citizen-science project that only uses open source tools and shares data on GNU public license. Which means that contributing and editing can be done collaboratively by the stake-holders. At the end of the mandate, December 31, 2021, hammerdirt will assume the responsibility of maintaining the code and data repository which is hosted publicly on Github.

The associations that participated are actively seeking ways to incorporate the process or the results into their own business model. However, there is a shortage of data scientists within many regional associations which may lengthen the process of integration and stifle the rate of innovation at the level where it is needed most.

## Recommendations

### Monitoring and reporting

Efficiencies in data exchange and reporting would be realized immediately by defining a standard reporting format. This in turn would make it easier for regional administrations to communicate priorities to other stakeholders. Which would facilitate monitoring strategies and help define reduction targets.

> Develop a network of associations that are responsible for sampling and reporting of the results.

> Create a standard report format to facilitate communications between municipal, cantonal and regional/district administrations and improve coordination of regional and local reduction strategies.

> Establish the next sampling period or the interval of sampling

Formally include academia in the planning, sampling and analysis. This project was influenced with collaborative university professors from ETH, UNIGE, EPFL, PSI and FHNW. University partners would be ideal to continue developing analytical methods. The Citizen Science Center (ETH) and Citizen Cyberlab (UNIGE) have the experience and infrastructure to connect citizen science monitoring projects to research efforts. Thus, creating a very adaptive and efficient monitoring plan.

### Elimination and reduction

Strategies for eliminating or reducing trash in the water should first consider the source.

__Objects associated with land use features__

The results show that there is a `positive` association between the amount of buildings and the amount of food and tobacco items. This suggests that prevention and elimination strategies for these objects should begin in areas that have high concentrations of buildings or infrastructure in proximity to the shoreline. The results from the Rhône survey area suggests that local awareness campaigns may have a positive effect and should be considered first if not already in place. Other reduction strategies may include:

* Adequate weather and animal resistant trash receptacles
* Increased trash removal and sweeping schedule
* Discourage single use plastics and plastic snack wrappers

Many of these recommendations are in-place or are being considered. For example reusable cups and plates, on consignment, are standard items at many outdoor festivals. However, reusable or consignment containers are not the standard of practice for all establishments year round. It should be noted that France has banned single use plates, cups, cutlery and straws since January 2021. All actions should seek to prevent objects from entering the storm water system at the street level. Street sweeping is the most efficient method to remove objects once they are on the ground. 

There are products on the market made to filter out trash after it enters the stormwater system but before it enters the lake or river. The system of retaining nets has been fielded in France with success but does require investments in infrastructure, equipment and labor. 

__Objects not associated with land use__

Objects that do not have a positive association with land use require a coordinated action at least at the level of the lake or river, and all locations upstream from intended survey locations. Of the most common objects these include:

* Fragmented plastics
* Fragmented foams
* Construction plastics
* Industrial pellets
* Cotton swabs
* Industrial sheeting

These objects are $\approx$ 40% of all objects found. They have industrial and personal hygiene applications, typically not associated with activities at the beach. These objects are not the subject of awareness campaigns, this may be a good time to start. Organizations will need time to develop communication strategies and other stakeholders may want to look at internal material loss prevention programs and material handling techniques.

Cotton swabs, which enter the lake or river through the water treatment facilities are a particular challenge. In England the use of plastic cotton swabs has been banned since October 2020, In France this has been effective since January 2020. Industrial sheeting is also a challenge because of its variety of outdoor uses. Similar to plastic bags, industrial sheeting has a tendency to be transported by the wind.

Reduction strategies may include:

* Upgrading waste water treatment facilities to reduce material loss
* Awareness campaigns for specific objects or products
* Awareness campaigns for specific industries

Elimination and reduction strategies for these objects needs a coordinated regional action that includes the communities upstream of the survey locations. 

Reducing reliance on single use plastics, foamed plastics, construction plastics and industrial sheeting and films would likely greatly reduce the quantities escaping into the natural environment. The low cost and disposable nature of these materials have resulted in an ever-increasing abundance and reliance in all sectors. The light-weight and degradable attributes of these materials facilitate fragmentation and absconding into the natural systems especially with prolonged exposure outdoors. These pollutants are a global problem and increasingly nations are banning specific single use plastic items and polystyrenes.
