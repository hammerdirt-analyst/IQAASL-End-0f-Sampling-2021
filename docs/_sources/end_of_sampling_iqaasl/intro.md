# The Litter Surveyor Report

__Edition 1__ ver=0.6 _the countdown version_

The _Litter Surveyor_ is a summary and analysis of the beach-litter surveys conducted and the methods employed in Switzerland from April 2020
to May 2021.

The survey results are presented down to the municipal level for each water feature and municipality that was sampled. The results
are in units of _pieces of trash per 100 meters_ (p/100m). 

The emphasis of the analysis is the identification of measured environmental variables within a fixed radius of 1500m around each
survey location that may have a statistically significant impact (+,-) on survey results. In this edition environmental variables are
drawn from the swiss land use survey of 2018 {cite}`superficie` and the current topographical layers from swissTLMRegio {cite}`tlmregio`.
Various non parametric tests are applied including bootstrap methods to identify differences between groups of survey results in space and time.

The key indicators chapter gives a precise definition of each of the basic statistics that can be derived from the survey results
and how they are used for identifying zones of accumulation and significant events. The methods used to calculate the different 
environmental variables are explained in [_The land use profile_](luseprofile). The codes and descriptions used to identify the
items as well as the different economic groupings are covered in detail in [_Code groups_](codegroups).

The _Findings_ section are topics chosen by the litter surveyors that are based on experiences in the field and demonstrated
using the data from the surveys. For this first edition the survey results were placed in the context of the _Law for the protection
of the environment_ {cite}`lpe` (LPE) and current EU guidance on calculating baselines {cite}`eubaselines`. The survey methods were implemented in the alpine environment to determine feasibility of the
current protocol and evaluate a common reporting method for all stakeholders.

## Summary of all surveys

The sampling period (SP) was from April 01, 2020 - May 31, 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) {cite}`slr` the
last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the _Guide to monitoring beach litter_ or any other comparable method.

_There were 386 samples from 143 locations in 77 different municipalities._

The median survey result was 158 pieces per 100 meters (p/100m), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 137p/100m - 188/p100m. This represents 54,337 recorded objects or
$\approx$ 306kg of trash including $\approx$ 96kg of plastic. The total linear distance surveyed was $\approx$ 20 km or a surface area of 9 hectares. The study was focussed on lakes, 331/385 samples come from 11 lakes. Both Geneva
and Zurich are included putting the total municipal population with a stake in this report at 1.7 million.

See the section [_All Survey areas_](allsurveys) for complete details.

## Trends from 2017

**When the lake and rivers with samples in both projects are considered** there was no statistical difference between the SLR results and IQAASL. The survey results
show that in 2020 there were fewer cigarettes, bottle tops and glass fragments and more cotton swabs, industrial sheeting and plastic construction waste.

## Shared responsibility

According to the Law for the protection of the environment the pincipal of causality is defined as:

> The person who initiates a measure prescribed by this Act shall bear the costs thereof.

We use beach litter survey results to move up the causal chain to identify secondary sources of litter.

## Baseline and extreme values

The proposed methods in the JRC Technical document _An Analysis of a pan-European 2012-2016 beach litter dataset_ are applied to the results from IQAASL. The baseline values are calculated for each survey area and examples are given of the the different methods to identify extreme values.

*Is this alot of trash to find at the beach?*

See the section [_Beach litter baselines_](threshhold) for sample calculations and a detailed explanation.

## Sources

Economically the sources are determined by grouping the codes assigned to the objects according to use or description. Combined food and tobacco items make up 36% of the items found and infrastructure and agriculture are 24% of the total. Objects originating from waste water facilities or objects less than five millimeters make up another 10%. The relative amounts change for each survey area suggesting that local priorities may not always match regional priorities.

See the section [_Code groups_](codegroups) for a complete definition of how the codes were grouped.

## Using this document

This document is designed to be easy to use for researchers and managers that are developing methods to reduce waste in the environment. The units are given in
a standard reporting format and the identification codes are based on a standard EU format. 

This document is a collection of scripts written in python and markdown contained in a series of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis. This
system has been in use for quite some time in the research community. Together those scripts make a book, or a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).
For researchers and administrators this removes the initial task of data wrangling and allows them to focus on their areas of expertise. Interested individuals or groups are invited to submit methods and make improvements. 

The surveyor uses this application [plagespropres](https://www.plagespropres.ch/) to submit data and the report is processed here: [end of sampling repo](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021).

## Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.
