# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

## The purpose, structure and evolution of this report

Our purpose is to provide a repeatable method and process to collect and evaluate beach-litter data at a scale that is appropriate to Switzerland and exploitable by
all stakeholders. The method and process need to reflect current advances in the field

1. Provide the results of the beach litter surveys at a scale that is appropriate to different administration levels.
   
2. Provide a method and process to present and propose analysis of the data resulting from litter surveys.
   
3. Provide a method to enter data and incorporate efforts from disparate stakeholders.

This document is a collection of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis. It is connected to the surveyors phone by the submit button with this
application https://www.plagespropres.ch/. It allows surveyors to focus on data collection and analysis.

Interested municipalities or organisations that already have a _data Scientist_ or _developer_ will be familiar with the methods used to exploit or contribute to this
report. You are welcome to making this yours. 

__How to use this document__

The survey results can be consulted directly, check the section _Tools and methods_ for a more detailed example of how to calculate a statistic. The _findings_ section
explains __statistically relevant__ analysis based on one of the key indicators. In this case (V0.001) the articles are being developed for peer review publication.

### Structure

1. Tools and methods
   * Key indicators: A description and example of using simple statistical indicators to locate probable sources from the survey results.     
   * Land use profile: The method and sample calculations to integrate "land use statistics" into survey results. Each survey location has a
   _land use profile_ that describes the economic activity within 1500m of the survey location
   * Baseline values: Application of the EU method for calculating beach-litter baselines values is applied to IQAASL survey results
     
2. Findings
   * More and less trash: An analysis of the results from the 2018 Swiss Litter Report and IQAASL. Comparison between the lakes and rivers
   that had surveys in both years.     
   * Transport an empirical approach: By trying to answer the  question "Where are the high density plastics?" we found that the distribution
   of plastic construction waste and fragmented plastics was similar indifferent of the land use profile of the survey location.
     
3. Survey results ! read the key indicators first !
   * The survey results presented by survey area.
   
### Evolution

Municipalities and organizations can request specific analysis or additional analysis. Send an email to analyst@hammerdirt.ch in french, german or english. We will
be happy to help develop an analysis package for different applications. This document and all tools are open source and frequently used by students and professionals
in Statistics or Data Science.

The new automated programming interface is being developed here: https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/iqals. The complete redesign is based on the lessons learned from
this project.
