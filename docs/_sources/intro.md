# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

## The Litter Surveyor Report

This report is a synthesis and analysis of beach litter data collected in Switzerland since April 2017. The method used to collect the data is described by
_The Guide on monitoring marine litter_. {cite}`mlwguidance`

1. Tools and methods
   * Key indicators: A description and example of using simple statistical indicators to locate probable sources from the survey results.     
   * Land use profile: The method and sample calculations to integrate "land use statistics" into survey results. Each survey location has a
   _land use profile_ that describes the economic activity within 1500m of the survey location
   * references
     
2. Findings
   * More and less trash: An analysis of the results from the 2018 Swiss Litter Report and IQAASL. Comparison between the lakes and rivers
   that had surveys in both years.     
   * Transport an empirical approach: By trying to answer the  question "Where are the high density plastics?" we found that the distribution
   of plastic construction waste and fragmented plastics was similar indifferent of the land use profile of the survey location.
   * Baseline values: Application of the EU method for calculating, confidence intervals, baselines and extreme values to IQAASL survey results
     
3. Survey results ! read the key indicators first !
   * The survey results presented by survey area.

### The structure and evolution of this report

This document is a collection of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis. It is connected to the surveyors phone by the submit button with this
application https://www.plagespropres.ch/. It allows surveyors to focus on data collection and analysis.

Our purpose is to provide a repeatable method and process to collect and evaluate beach-litter data at a scale that is appropriate to Switzerland and exploitable by
all stakeholders. The method and process need to reflect current advances in the field and the needs of stakeholders.

The project, data collection and analysis are all based on a participatory model. If you would like to help contact
