# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rhône, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

## The Litter Surveyor Report

This report uses the techniques developed here in Switzerland and in the EU to identify zones of accumulation of the most common litter
objects found along the vast network of rivers and lakes in Switzerland. The front line against waste is the municipality. However,
neither the trash nor the waterways respect the municipal boundaries.

The European Union (EU), in September 2020, set baselines and established target values for beach-litter assessments for all member states. 
The values were calculated using data collected following the same protocol as has been used in Switzerland since 2015 {cite}`mlwguidance` {cite}`slr`. This decision brings a common
measuring and benchmarking method to a harmonized data collection protocol {cite}`eubaselines`. 

Current research points to inland lakes as transition points for garbage transported by rivers, some of that trash goes on to the next lake and some of
it remains and degrades in the lake where it was deposited. For Switzerland that means our lakes could be _sinks_ or _dumps_ for garbage and that it does
not all go on to the ocean. {cite}`Kooi2018`

The _Litter Surveyor Report_ provides a set of tools to interpret current beach litter survey results and presents the results from past and present
beach litter surveys in light of recent developments. 

## Summary

The sampling period (SP) was from April 01, 2020 - May 31, 2021. This date range overlaps with the start and end date of the Swiss Litter Report (SLR) {cite}`slr` the
last national level project to use the standard protocol described in the _Guide to monitoring beach litter_ or any other comparable method. There were 385 samples from 143 locations
in 77 different municipalities.

The median survey result was 158 pieces per 100 meters (p/100m), with a 95% confidence interval of 137p/100m - 188/p100m. This represents 54,713 recorded objects or
$\approx$ 306kg of trash including 96kg of plastic. The total linear distance surveyed was approximately 20 km or a surface area of 9 hectares. The study was focussed on lakes, 331/385 samples come from 11 lakes. Both Geneva
and Zurich are included putting the total municipal population with a stake in this report at 1.7 million.

See the section [_All Survey areas_](allsurveys) for complete details.

### Trends from 2017

**When the lake and rivers with samples in both projects are considered** there was no statistical difference between the SLR results and IQAASL. The survey results
show that in 2020 there were fewer cigarettes, bottle tops and glass fragments and more cotton swabs, industrial sheeting and plastic construction waste.

The comparison of survey results from both projects also shows that **a positive statistically relevant association** can be attributed to items related to the consumption
of food or tobacco products and the level and type of economic development within 1500m of the survey location. Confirming observations in the SLR that litter
survey results were increased in urban and suburban environments.

Other objects like fragmented plastics, fragmented foams and industrial sheeting have few if any positive associations in either project year and the observed
levels remained within the range encountered in the SLR.

### Local versus regional

Beach litter surveys are collections of many individual surveys. Here we compare the results of two different groups of items under two opposite land use conditions
(see [_The land use profile_](luseprofile). In one group the use case is well known and the connection to human behavior and the land use is uncontested: tobacco and
snacks, this group is called _contributed_. The other group includes fragmented objects of different densities, specific objects less than 5mm and construction plastics,
none of which show any association to measurable land use features, this group is called distributed

The results of the test show that the distributed objects are found at similar rates regardless of land use class. Suggesting that there is another mechanism of transport
and deposition for these objects that is not directly associated with behavior. The presence of high density plastics in this group and the numerous river or canal discharge
sites within 1500 meters of every survey location support previous observations that these objects are being transported to the survey site and a portion of them are sinking
or beaching within proximity of the survey site.


See the section [_Transport an empirical approach_](transport)

### Sources

Geographically a potential source can be determined based on the median survey result of an object in relation to its distance from a probable source. An example
of this is given in the section _Key Statistical Indicators_. Certain objects, like pre-production plastic pellets (GPI), cigarette ends or cable-ties are easy to 
identify and changes in the relative amounts these objects are easy to spot. This is a benefit of using the median value as a baseline.

On a regional basis any stream/river/canal should be considered a source of fragmented plastics and construction plastics. They have a tendency to
sink after they transition from river to lake, as result they accumulate near where they are deposited. The communities nearest the hydrological exchanges
tend to have increased survey results with a wider variety of objects.

Economically the sources are determined by grouping the codes assigned to the objects according to use or description. Combined food and tobacco items make up 36%
of the items found and infrastructure and agriculture are 24% of the total. Objects originating from waste water facilities or objects less than five millimeters 
make up another 10%. The relative amounts change for each survey area suggesting that local priorities may not always match regional priorities.

See the section [_Code groups_](codegroups) for a complete definition of how the codes were grouped.

### Baseline and extreme values

A subset of the IQAASL data was used to calculate the median and a target value based on the methods proposed by the JRC Technical document. It is compared here
to the subset of data used to generate the baseline value for EU neighboring states. The baseline values are calculated for each survey area and lake in the study
and included with the survey results.

In Switzerland the 15th percentile of survey results was 45p/100m with a 95% CI of 39p/100m to 53p/100m.  This is twice the proposed target value for beaches in
the EU zone of 20p/100m. Surveys in the Meusse-Rhine delta from 2017 and 2018 are very similar to the results recorded in Switzerland. On a per country basis the median of
survey results for the EU ranges from 14 (Romania) to 2,430 (France, bay of Biscay). The median was 133p/100m for all EU countries, close to the lower bound of the
median survey value for Switzerland in 2020.

#### Extreme values

The definition of extreme values as a matter of policy is not the intent of this document. Mathematically though a value could be defined against which all others
are compared. Using the survey total of all objects does not take into account the regional differences and priorities, nor the variety of objects found. Approximately
60% to 70% of the survey total can be described by 10 - 12 objects.

In general survey results were higher in the Rhône survey area (RSA) than the other survey areas, both in terms of the median survey totals and the median totals of the most common
objects. This despite having fewer total number of samples than the Linth and Aare survey areas. Differences among regions are common and related to the economic and
industrial development of the catchment area.

St. Gingolph has the highest median value of fragmented plastics and construction plastics of any other location with more than three samples in the SP. Similar results were recorded
for St. Gingolph in the SLR. These objects can also be found in quantities that regularly exceed the national median on Bielersee and Brienzersee. Industrial pellets are found
in all survey areas but high/extreme values have been recorded in Préverenges, Genève, Biel, Lugano and Brienze.

See the section [_Calculating baseline values_](threshhold) for sample calculations and a detailed explanation.

### The structure and evolution of this document

The purpose is to provide a repeatable method and process to collect and evaluate beach-litter data at a scale that is appropriate to Switzerland and exploitable by
all stakeholders. The method and process need to reflect current advances in the field, the needs of stakeholders and faithfully report the survey results as collected
by the surveyor.

This document is a collection of scripts written in python and markdown contained in a series of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis. This
system has been in use for quite some time in the research community. Together those scripts make a book, or a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

The surveyor uses this application [plagespropres](https://www.plagespropres.ch/) to submit data and the report is processed here: [end of sampling repo](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021).

Not all tasks have been automated. Land use data is calculated using QGIS and the method to automate this process has not been developed.
