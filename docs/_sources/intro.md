# Identification, quantification and analysis of observable anthropogenic debris along swiss river and lakes (IQAASL)

IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

## The Litter Surveyor Report

The European Union (EU), in 2020, set baselines and established target values for beach-litter assessments for all member states. The values
were calculated using data collected following the same protocol as has been used in Switzerland since 2015. This decision brings a common
measuring and benchmarking scheme based on the aggregated median value of survey results. 

This report uses the techniques developed here in Switzerland and in the EU to gain insight into the transport and accumulation of trash with respect
to the vast network of rivers and lakes. In Switzerland the front line against waste is the municipality. However, neither the trash nor the 
waterways respect the municipal boundaries.  Now there is a common system of measurement and methodology that can move with the water and the trash.

This report is a synthesis and analysis of beach litter data collected in Switzerland since April 2017. The method used to collect the data is
described by _The Guide on monitoring marine litter_ {cite}`mlwguidance`. 

1. Executive summary

2. Tools and methods: how to read the charts and graphs, how to determine land use
   * Key indicators: A description and example of using simple statistical indicators to locate probable sources from the survey results.     
   * Land use profile: The method and sample calculations to integrate "land use statistics" into survey results. Each survey location has a
   _land use profile_ that describes the economic activity within 1500m of the survey location
   * references
     
3. Findings: the principal results on a national scale and how they pertain to regional results.
   * More and less trash: An analysis of the results from the 2018 Swiss Litter Report and IQAASL. Comparison between the lakes and rivers
   that had surveys in both years.     
   * Transport an empirical approach: By trying to answer the  question "Where are the high density plastics?" we found that the distribution
   of plastic construction waste and fragmented plastics was similar indifferent of the land use profile of the survey location.
   * Baseline values: Application of the EU method for calculating, confidence intervals, baselines and extreme values to IQAASL survey results
     
4. Survey results: the survey results presented with respect to the key indicators
   * The survey results presented by survey area.

### The structure and evolution 

This document is a collection of notebooks designed specifically for completing data analysis [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). It is connected to the surveyors phone by the submit button with this
application https://www.plagespropres.ch/. The data is processed and the report is produced here [end of sampling repo](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021).

The purpose is to provide a repeatable method and process to collect and evaluate beach-litter data at a scale that is appropriate to Switzerland and exploitable by
all stakeholders. The method and process need to reflect current advances in the field, the needs of stakeholders and faithfully report the survey results as collected
by the surveyor.

As a result the requirements to be a surveyor include technical skills that are not usually associated with the field. The project, data collection
and analysis are all based on a participatory model. If you would like to help contact dev@hammerdirt.ch
