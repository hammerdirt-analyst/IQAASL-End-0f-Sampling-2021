IQAASL is a project sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment to quantify shoreline trash along swiss lakes and rivers. Multiple small scale **litter surveys** are completed at different locations within a designated survey area. For the year 2020/2021 the survey areas were defined by the municipalities that border the Aare, Rh√¥ne, Ticino and Linth/Limmat rivers and any lakes or rivers that contribute.

**What is a litter survey?**

A litter survey is the **identification and count of all anthropogenic objects found within a delimited area**, in this study all surveys were bordered on one side by water (a river or lake). Each object is placed into one of 260 categories. The location, date, survey dimensions and the total number of objects in each category is noted. 

**Purpose of the surveys**

The survey results help ALL stakeholders identify the items that make up the mass of trash found in the natural environment and where those objects are most likely to be found. The surveys answer the following questions:

*  What items are found?
   * The most abundant objects from the water feature and the survey area sorted by total object count 
*  How much is found ? (total weights and item counts)
   * Total object count, total weight and weight of plastics
*  How often are these items found?
   * How often the most abundant items were identified
*  Where do you find the most?
   * Pieces of trash per meter (pcs/m): the ratio of number of objects found to the length of the shoreline for each survey location

These are the most frequently asked questions and should be considered in the context of mitigation or reduction strategies.

## Assumptions:

*  The more trash there is on the ground the more a person is likely to find
*  **The survey results represent the minimum amount of trash at that site**
*  For each survey: finding one item does not affect the chance of finding another

## Interpreting results:

These results are the aggregated survey results for each water feature in the survey area. The median survey result for an object or water feature or location is the result at which 50% of the results fall either above or below. Therefore, the number of samples is very important when attempting to draw conclusions from these results.
